Laravel 5 Example
================================

This repo is for my personal use, started for Laravel 5 & Yii 2 comparison. The original `laravel-admin` project has
become `laravel-blog`(because I need a clean blog system), it's [in here](https://github.com/AaronJan/laravel-blog).

This is a comment system DEMO written with `Laravel 5` and `Semantic-UI`, if you can get to know about `Laravel 5` from this, I'll be very glad for you.

After I written this, I found a [more complicated example](https://github.com/bestmomo/laravel5-example), you may like that.

If you are interesting at learning about `Yii 2`, my other [Yii 2 example](https://github.com/AaronJan/yii2-example) **OMGï¼Œmy code is missing from Github** may demonstrated a little Yii 2.

## TODO

Write some sort of Laravel 5 101
